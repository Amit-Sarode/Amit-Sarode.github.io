Despite coming from a non-traditional background with a Bachelor of Arts degree, I’ve pursued my passion for programming through real-world projects, continuous learning, and dedication. I specialize in building clean, user-focused interfaces using React, Redux, Tailwind CSS, and MUI. I’ve also expanded into mobile development with React Native, creating innovative apps like an OCR-based number plate scanner and a multilingual AI voice diary. My work combines a strong eye for design with scalable code architecture and API integration. Currently, I’m working at Atum Information Technologies, where I contribute to projects that solve real-world problems. I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and the desire to build things that make a difference."})]}),e.jsxs("div",{children:["add certificates here",a.map((i,t)=>e.jsx("img",{className:"text-center px-10 h-[500px] w-[800px]",loading:"lazy",src:i.url},t))]})]})};export{r as default};
